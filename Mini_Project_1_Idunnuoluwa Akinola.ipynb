    "Reproduction is  essential for the continuance of humanity. However research has shown that over the decades sperm count in men seems to have decreased. There is no specific cause and effect that can precisely tell us the reason for this decrease in sperm count, but there are certain factors apart from genentics that could lead to this decrease in sperm count.\n",

    "A good amount of people in society report wanting to have their own offspring in the future. It is very important to know what enviromental or social factors could affect this. Futhermore government official would want to know if there are factors in society that could potentially influence growth rate.\n",

This research could bring to new light  to a pontential issue for the continuance of humanity as a whole.Depending on the results from the research, government agencies and individuals could bring more awareness to male trauma and accidents and how to decrease the occurence of these events in society"

    "We discovered a dataset from the Kaggle website.The dataset is  made from an experiment comprised of 100 male volunteers who provide semen to WHO in 2010, futhermore WHO collected some data about the volunteers socio-demographic status, environmental factors, health status and life habits.The dataset consist of 100 rows and 10 column. The variables Include season when observation occured, age of volunteer, If volunteer has had a childish disease, If volunteer was involved in Accident or serious trauma, If volunteer has had surgery in the past, If volunteer has had high fevers in the past year, alcohol consumption frequency,smoking habits, number of hours spent sitting down per day and If sperm count was altered or normal. The dataset failed to provide observation on the hormonal balance of the volunteer, obesity level , emotional issues and any infections the volunteer may have. In this analysis we ae going to explore the age of the volunteer, if the volunteer has had any accident or serious trauma and whether or not their sperm was altered.Provide below is the link to this data set which was downloaded on Wednesday the 20th of september 2023.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhamedyoussry/fertility-data-set?datasetId=682005"

    "To analyze the data first we are going to compare the boxplots with summary statistics. we will start with the volunteers who said they have had an accident or serious trauma, we are going to compare volunteers with normal and altered diagnosis. we are going to be compare the measure of center,measure of spread,shape and outliers. For the measure of center, we can see that the median for individual who had accidents or serious trauma with normal sperm count is higher than those with altered sperm count. For the center of spread the range for normal diagnosis is higher than that of altered diagnosis this tells us more people who have had an accident or serious trauma have a normal diagnosis. the shape of the normal diagnosis is negatively  or left skwed and for the altered diagnosis the shape is unimodal. For both normal and altered diagnosis they have no outliers.\n",

For the center comparision the median for altered is higher than that of normal. The altered diagnosis is more skewed than the normal diagnosis. The normal diagnosis has more outliers than the altered diagnosis. the spread of the normal diagnosis is bigger than that of altered."

    "Based on the visualization we can see that most most of the men that had trauma or a serious accident still had a normal sperm count and we can also see that men who no trauma still had altered sperm count. we can aslo see that younger men still had a lower sperm count. From the result we can definitely see that there is no true connection between trauma,accident,age and sperm count."

    "In Conclusion we can that there is no real realtionship between age, involvement in accident or serious trauma and sperm count. I think one think that could have made the results clearer is if there were more variables to compare, because I definitely think that there are more variables like genetics and nutrition that could affect this. one Idea that I have for future work is to compare sperm count between continents and explore other variables to see if there are more reasons why some continents have a higher growth rate."
